# Media Directory

This directory contains media files for the project.

## demo.mp4

The `demo.mp4` file should be added to this directory. This demo video should showcase:

1. The application startup
2. Using the Image-to-3D feature
3. Using the Text-to-3D feature
4. Downloading the resulting 3D models

For the best quality demonstration:
- Record at 720p or higher resolution
- Keep the video under 2 minutes
- Include captions or narration explaining each step
- Show the actual 3D models in a viewer after exporting

This video will be embedded in the main README.md file.
